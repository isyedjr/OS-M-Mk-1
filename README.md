# Open Source Microscope Mk 1 (OS-M Mk 1)

Welcome! This is the GitHub repository for OS-M Mk 1. You'll find useful hardware plans and software in this repository.

## How to Use
View the Instructions Doc in the Documents folder and download software from the software folder. This is open source, so it is meant to be shared and cloned! Feel free to fork this repository, improve and share!

## Updates
The Keyboard Control scripts are still being tested. As of now, only the joystick and button control system is stable.

## Useful Files & Links
In the Documents folder, there are some documents that are useful for designing an optical microscope with an OPU lens. This is most useful for anyone trying to develop their own prototype, as this provides the focal length and other properties of the OPU lens, as well as mounting and imaging distances.
